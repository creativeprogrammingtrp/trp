                        <p>Scale Financial is a service owned and operated by TRPS Inc. The following describes the Terms and Conditions (as amended or otherwise changed from time to time, the “Terms and Conditions”) applicable to the services available through the Scalefinancial.com web site (the “Site”) from TRPS Inc. By visiting the Site, you are accepting the Terms and Conditions described herein.</p>

                        <h4>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h4>
                        <p>We value your trust in us and will work hard to earn your confidence so that you can enthusiastically use our services and recommend us to others.</p>

                        <h4>Information We Collect</h4>
                        <p>We collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) about you that you specifically provide to us while using the Site. Personal Data includes information that can identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address and IP address.
                            As part of our evaluation and monitoring process, we may also collect Personal Data from non-affiliated third parties such as credit bureaus, employers, and financial institutions.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Protecting Your Personal Data</h4>
                        <p>We take our responsibility to protect the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Data very seriously. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with federal standards to store and secure your information from unauthorized access, alteration, and destruction. Our control policies restrict access to your personal and account information to those employees who need to access that information to provide products or services to you.</p>
                        <p>The Personal Data you provide us is saved in a secure environment and is kept in our records to make it easier for you to use our services on return visits to our web site.</p>
                        <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure correct use of information, we will employ reasonable and current Internet security methods and technologies.</p>

                        <h4>How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>
                        <p>We use the Personal Data we collect to provide you with the products and services you use through our programs.</p>

                        <h4>Disclosure to Third Parties</h4>
                        <p>We share Personal Data with non-affiliated third parties that provide services to us or with you for operation of our programs, including banks that operate as the depository/ institution for products we offer. In other cases, we only disclose Personal Data to non-affiliated third parties as permitted or required by law.</p>

                        <h4>Our Policy Concerning Cookies</h4>
                        <p>To serve you faster and with better quality, we use “cookies” technology. Cookies are small bits of code, usually stored on a user’s computer hard drive, which enable a Web site to “personalize” itself for each user.</p>

                        <h4>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                        <p>We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason.
                            For information on how we collect, store, share or otherwise use your personal information, see our privacy policy. In addition to your personal information, whenever you visit or interact with the Website, Scale Financial, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect general, non-personal, statistical, technical and navigational information about our visitors, and information about how the Website is accessed and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include, in part, browser type and version, Flash version, operating system, the page served, the time, and the preceding page views. This statistical data provides us with information about the use of the Website, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on our Website, how long they stay on that page, whether they complete applications or information fields on a web page, which product pictures or other hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of our Website are most popular; to tailor our Website to your specific interests, participation or requests; to improve user experience for our visitors; for security and authentication purposes; and to deliver a more personalized web site service and experience, including by recognizing certain choices you have made on our Website so you do not need to re-enter these choices when you return to our Website, or by notifying you of incomplete applications or registrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>We also automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifiers (“Device Identifier”) for the computer, mobile device, technology or other device (collectively, “Device”) you use to access the Websites. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you access a website or its servers, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.
                            If you install certain mobile applications, involving location-based services (such as the ATM locator) or use other mobile optimized services on the Website, we may have access to certain information about your location. We collect location-based information in order to provide the specific mobile application location-based service you request. We may employ third parties to perform services on our behalf, such as administering mobile applications with location based services. Such third parties will have access to login credentials (and your location information if you choose to use a mobile application location-based service) only to the extent necessary to perform their services, but will not be permitted to use it for any other purpose. Except as set forth in these Terms of Use, or in terms of use applicable to the specific mobile application that generates location-based information, your location will not be shared with third parties without your specific consent.
                        </p>

                        <p>We may use third parties to assist us with the collection of such Usage Information and Device Identifiers through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking technologies.
                            Cookies are data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Website. The web analytics provider that we may use to help manage our Website and communications, or our third-party advertising and/or security service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security and authentication purposes, to deliver our ads, to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, to learn how our users use our Website, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Website. Most Devices allow you to modify your preferences or browser settings to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. However, please be aware that some features and services on our Website may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. In addition, the offers we provide when you visit us may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests. You may occasionally get cookies from other third parties on our Website. We do not control these cookies.
                        </p>

                        <h4>E-Verify</h4>
                        <p>We use proprietary technology to access your IRS E-Services account with your permission. ERO’s (Electronic Return Originators) who use the E-Verify service to enroll with Scale Financial should be aware that we use software to access your E-Services account and gather information about your firm instantly. ERO’s should log into their IRS E-Services account and keep their information current. The Scale Financial E-Verify service does not access your IRS E-Services account without your permission.

Please be aware that Scale Financial, at its sole discretion may turn away ERO’s based on the information gathered via our IRS E-Services and E-Verify report.</p>
                        <p>Scale Financial’s E-Verify software does not and will not add, delete or modify any information stored on the IRS E-Services system. Scale Financial strictly complies with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 and 1030.</p>
                        <p>Please be aware that by using the Scale Financial E-Verify platform you are complying with the following statement from the IRS:</p>
                        <p>WARNING! You are using an Official United States Government System, which may be used only for authorized purposes.
